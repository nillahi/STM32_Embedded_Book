# Timers and PWM Generation - Code Examples

This directory contains all the code examples from **Timers and PWM Generation** of the STM32 Embedded Systems Programming book.

## Code Examples

 1. **`code_example_40.c`** - Code Example 40
 2. **`code_example_41.c`** - Code Example 41
 3. **`code_example_42.c`** - Code Example 42
 4. **`code_example_43.c`** - Code Example 43

## Quick Start

1. **Choose an example**: Pick a code file that matches your learning goal
2. **Copy to project**: Copy the `.c` file to your STM32 project directory
3. **Include headers**: Add necessary STM32 HAL includes to your project
4. **Configure hardware**: Use STM32CubeMX to set up pins and peripherals
5. **Build and flash**: Compile and upload to your STM32 board

## Hardware Setup

- **STM32 Development Board**: STM32F4 Discovery (recommended) or Nucleo board
- **Basic Components**: LEDs, buttons, resistors, jumper wires
- **ST-LINK Programmer**: Usually integrated on development boards
- **Optional**: Oscilloscope, multimeter for advanced debugging

## Software Setup

- **STM32CubeIDE**: Free IDE from STMicroelectronics
- **STM32 HAL Library**: Hardware Abstraction Layer (included with CubeIDE)
- **STM32CubeMX**: Configuration tool (included with CubeIDE)

## Learning Tips

1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic examples (LED blinking, button reading)
2. **Read the comments**: Each example includes detailed explanations
3. **Experiment**: Try modifying parameters and observe the results
4. **Combine examples**: Create more complex projects by combining multiple examples
5. **Reference the book**: Use the detailed explanations in the main book

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

- **Build errors**: Check that all STM32 HAL headers are included
- **Hardware not working**: Verify pin assignments in STM32CubeMX
- **Clock issues**: Ensure clock configuration matches your board
- **Peripheral errors**: Check that required peripherals are enabled

### Getting Help:

1. Check the code comments for implementation details
2. Review the STM32 HAL documentation
3. Consult the main book for detailed explanations
4. Check the STM32 community forums
