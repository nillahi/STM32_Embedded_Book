## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Choose Your Learning Path

- **Beginner**: Start with Chapter 2 - LED blinking and basic concepts
- **Intermediate**: Jump to Chapter 7 (GPIO) or Chapter 8 (Interrupts)
- **Advanced**: Explore Chapter 10 (ADC/DAC) or Chapter 11 (Capstone Projects)

### 2. Hardware Requirements

- **STM32 Development Board**: 
  - STM32F4 Discovery (recommended for most examples)
  - STM32F7 Discovery (for advanced examples)
  - Nucleo boards (compatible with most examples)
- **Basic Components**: LEDs, buttons, resistors, jumper wires
- **Optional**: Oscilloscope, multimeter for advanced debugging

### 3. Software Setup

- **STM32CubeIDE**: Download from [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
- **STM32 HAL Library**: Included with CubeIDE
- **STM32CubeMX**: Configuration tool (included with CubeIDE)

### 4. Running Your First Example

```bash
# 1. Navigate to Chapter 2
cd STM32_embedded_Code/Chapter_02_Introduction_to_Embedded_Systems/

# 2. Copy the LED blink example
cp code_example_01.c /path/to/your/stm32/project/

# 3. Open in STM32CubeIDE and configure your board
# 4. Build and flash to your development board
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Errors

- **Missing includes**: Check that all STM32 HAL headers are included
- **Undefined references**: Ensure all required HAL functions are linked
- **Clock errors**: Verify clock configuration in STM32CubeMX

### Hardware Issues

- **LED not blinking**: Check pin assignments and connections
- **Button not working**: Verify pull-up/pull-down configuration
- **UART not working**: Check baud rate and pin configuration

### Performance Issues

- **Slow execution**: Check clock configuration and optimization settings
- **High power consumption**: Review power management settings
- **Interrupt delays**: Verify interrupt priority configuration
